                                      //PART 2

//   You are planning a cross-country road trip!
//   The distance of the trip, in total, is 1,500 miles.
//   Your carâ€™s fuel efficiency is as follows:
//   At 55 miles per hour, you get 30 miles per gallon.
//   At 60 miles per hour, you get 28 miles per gallon.
//   At 75 miles per hour, you get 23 miles per gallon.
//   You have a fuel budget of $175.
//   The average cost of fuel is $3 per gallon.
//   Set up a program to answer the following questions:
    //   How many gallons of fuel will you need for the entire trip?
    //   Will your budget be enough to cover the fuel expense?
    //   How long will the trip take, in hours?
    //   Compare the results when traveling at an average of 55, 60, and 75 miles per hour. Which makes the most sense for the trip?
    //   Log the results of your calculations using string concatenation or template literals.

const totalDis = 1500;
const costPerGallon = 3;
const totalBudget = 175;

//Total gallons available for the trip
let availGallon = totalBudget/costPerGallon;
console.log(`Total fuel available for the trip is ${availGallon} gallons. \n\n`);

// Fuel efficiency @ 55 miles/hr --> 30 miles/gallon
let disTravel1 = availGallon*30;
console.log(`Maximum distance traveled @ 55 mi/hr ${disTravel1} miles. \n`);
console.log(`Can the car cover total distance: `, disTravel1 >= totalDis);
console.log(`\nHours taken to reach destination: `, totalDis/55);
console.log('\n\n');


// Fuel efficiency @ 60 miles/hr --> 28 miles/gallon
let disTravel2 = availGallon*28;
console.log(`Maximum distance traveled @ 60 mi/hr ${disTravel2} miles. \n`);
console.log(`Can the car cover total distance: `, disTravel2 >= totalDis);
console.log(`\nHours taken to reach destination: `, totalDis/60);
console.log('\n\n');


// Fuel efficiency @ 75 miles/hr --> 23 miles/gallon
let disTravel3 = availGallon*23;
console.log(`Maximum distance traveled @ 75 mi/hr ${disTravel3} miles. \n`);
console.log(`Can the car cover total distance: `, disTravel3 >= totalDis);
console.log(`\nHours taken to reach destination: `, totalDis/75);
console.log('\n\n');

//Comparison of all the above calculations in a concatenated string/template literals
console.log(`The total distance of the trip is ${totalDis} 
    and the total budget of the trip is $${totalBudget}.
    Considering the cost of fuel at $3/gallon, we have calculated
    that the total fuel available for the trip is ${availGallon}.
    If we travel @ 55 mi/hr, we can travel the total distance of ${disTravel1}
    and reach our destination in ${totalDis/55} hours.
    If we travel @ 60 mi/hr, we can travel the total distance of ${disTravel2}
    and reach our destination in ${totalDis/60} hours.
    If we travel @ 75 mi/hr, we can travel the total distance of ${disTravel3} 
    and reach our destination in ${totalDis/75} hours.
    But because ${disTravel3} is less than our total distance needed to be travelled,
    speeding @ 75 mi/hr is not within our budget.
    Thus, comparing all three, we can see that travelling @ 60 mi/hr is
    the best option as it falls under our budget and is quicker 
    than travelling @ 55 mi/hr.`);
